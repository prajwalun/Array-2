# The board is modified in place according to the game rules, where:
#   - A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors dies (underpopulation or overpopulation).
#   - A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

# Directions and Initial Setup:
#   - 'directions' is a list of 8 tuples representing the relative positions of the 8 neighboring cells for each cell.
#   - The outer loops iterate over each cell in the board by row (i) and column (j).
#   
# Neighbor Counting and Temporary State Update:
#   - For each cell (board[i][j]):
#       - Initialize 'live' to count the number of live neighbors.
#       - Check each neighboring cell in the 8 directions:
#           - If a neighbor is within bounds and is live (board[i+x][j+y] has absolute value 1), increment 'live'.
#       - Apply the game rules based on the current cellâ€™s state and live neighbors:
#           - If the cell is live (board[i][j] == 1) and has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, mark it as -1 (indicating it will die).
#           - If the cell is dead (board[i][j] == 0) and has exactly 3 live neighbors, mark it as 2 (indicating it will become live).
#   
# Final Update:
#   - After applying rules to all cells, another pass is made over the board:
#       - Convert temporary states to final states:
#           - Cells marked as positive (>0) become live (set to 1).
#           - Cells marked as 0 or negative are set to dead (0).

# TC: O(m * n) - Each cell and its neighbors are checked, resulting in linear time with respect to the board's size.
# SC: O(1) - The space complexity is constant as modifications are made in place on the board without extra storage.
